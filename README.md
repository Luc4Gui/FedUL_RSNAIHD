# FedUL_RSNAIHD
This is a PyTorch[1] implemention of the real-world problem part of paper [**Federated Learning from Only Unlabeled Data with
Class-Conditional-Sharing Clients**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WHA8009laxu)[2].

I was not a participant in the article, and a lot of code in this [**link**](https://github.com/lunanbit/FedUL) is referenced.  

The notebooks can be run on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/).
